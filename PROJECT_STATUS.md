# QWIZZ - Project Status Report

## ⚠️ System Status: **PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL - AUTHENTICATION ISSUES**

### ❌ Authentication System  
- ❌ **Registration**: Failing with 500 Internal Server Error
- ❌ **Login**: Failing with 500 Internal Server Error  
- ❌ **Dashboard Access**: Cannot access due to auth failures
- ⚠️ **API Security**: JWT configuration present but endpoints non-functional

### 👥 Demo Accounts (Created but Non-Functional)
```
Teacher Account:
- Username: teacher
- Password: password  
- Role: TEACHER
- Status: Created in DB but login fails

Student Account:
- Username: student
- Password: password
- Role: STUDENT  
- Status: Created in DB but login fails
```

### 🚀 Microservices Architecture
Mixed service status - some operational, some problematic:

| Service | Port | Status | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| Eureka Server | 8761 | ✅ RUNNING | Service Discovery |
| API Gateway | 8080 | ❌ STARTUP ISSUES | Request Routing & CORS |
| User Service | 8083 | ⚠️ RUNNING - 500 ERRORS | Authentication & User Management |
| Question Bank Service | 8081 | ✅ REGISTERED | Quiz & Question Management |
| Result Service | 8082 | ✅ REGISTERED | Quiz Results & Analytics |
| Analytics Service | 8084 | ✅ REGISTERED | Performance Analytics |

### 💻 Frontend Application
- ✅ **React App**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- ⚠️ **Authentication UI**: Forms present but backend auth failing
- ⚠️ **CORS Configuration**: Bypassing API Gateway (direct to user service)
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: UI components functional
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Fixed infinite loading on auth failures

### 🗄️ Database Configuration
- ✅ **MySQL Database**: `quiz_apc` database active and accessible
- ✅ **Connection Strings**: Services can connect to database
- ✅ **User Tables**: Properly created with ENUM types
- ✅ **Sample Data**: Demo users inserted with bcrypt passwords  
- ⚠️ **JPA/Hibernate**: Entity mappings may have issues causing 500 errors

### 🔧 Issues Identified & Fixes Applied
1. **✅ Frontend Loading Fix**: AuthContext now handles auth failures gracefully
2. **✅ Database Schema**: Recreated users table with proper ENUM types  
3. **✅ Sample Users**: Added test accounts with bcrypt-hashed passwords
4. **✅ Target Cleanup**: Removed all Maven target/ directories
5. **❌ User Service 500 Errors**: Authentication endpoints failing (needs debugging)
6. **❌ API Gateway Startup**: Java configuration causing startup failures
7. **⚠️ Service Integration**: Cannot test due to auth dependency

### 📝 Current Workaround
- **Frontend**: Configured to connect directly to user service (port 8083)  
- **API Gateway**: Bypassed until routing issues resolved
- **Authentication**: Non-functional but frontend doesn't hang
- **Testing**: Limited due to authentication dependency

## ❌ Project Health Score: **40%**

Critical authentication system is non-functional. Frontend and database are working, but user login/registration prevents full system testing. API Gateway has startup issues. Requires debugging of Spring Boot authentication service.
